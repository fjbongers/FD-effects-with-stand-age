Bongers et al NEE_species traits and CWM and FD
-> This code will show the correlations among all traits and show how to calculate the CWM and FD values for all 38 traits. Code for Fig S5 is included.

Bongers et al NEE_initial relationships and create metadata 
-> This code will show how the metadata was created from all productivity-community trait relationships for 10 years for both stand volume and stand volume increment.
Code for Figure S8 included

Bongers et al NEE_ analyse metadata
-> This code will show the mixed-effects models analyzing the effects of CWMvsFD and AGE on slope and R2 data. Code for main Figures 2, 3 and 4 and Fig S2, Fig S3 and Fig S4 are included.

Bongers et al NEE_multivariate FD and analyses
-> This code includes the pca's performed to get the PC1 values per trait groups. Consequennlty also the CWM and FD values, including the multivariate FD values, are calculated.
Additional "metadata" is created with these new multivarite trait values. Code for Figures S1 and S7 are included.  

Bongers et al NEE_calculate canopy closure
-> This code include the calculation for the closed canopy with stand age, see Fig S5.
